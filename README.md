# VGCamera - valerino's glass camera
## Google glass camera as it should have been

# Features:

* Can be controlled via touchpad too
* Always shows what the camera is looking at (preview mode), no more shooting pictures blindly!
* Zoom, can take zoomed pictures and/or videos
* Can take pictures while recording videos
* Configurable quality (high/low) for both videos and pictures
* Autosave (restart preview immediately after taken picture/video)
* Geotagging
* Sharing of the taken media on social networks / email
* Visible overlays to identify operation modes and selected options
* Stores the set configuration options across usages

# Modes of operation
There are 2 modes of operation : 

* 'Preview mode' (while recording or before taking a picture)
* 'Taken mode' (after recording has been stopped or picture taken).

Both modes can be controlled either handsfree and/or with the touchpad simultaneously (i.e. zoom with the touchpad, zoom more handsfree, take picture handsfree, save with the touchpad, and so on).

## Hands-free
### Preview mode
 1. Starts saying 'VGCamera', app will start in Preview mode
 2. Take picture with 'Ok Glass' -> 'Take a picture' as usual
 3. Start video recording with 'Ok Glass' -> 'Record a video' as usual
 4. Stop video recording with 'Ok Glass' -> 'Stop'
 5. Zoom with 'Ok Glass' -> 'Zoom' -> 'In' / 'Out'
 6. Toggle Maximum Zoom with 'Ok Glass' -> 'Zoom' -> 'Max'
 7. Toggle Smooth Zoom with 'Ok Glass' -> 'Zoom' -> 'Smooth'
 8. Toggle Autosave with 'Ok Glass' -> 'Options' -> 'Autosave'
 9. Toggle Geotagging with 'Ok glass' -> 'Options' -> 'Geotag'
 10. Toggle Overlay with 'Ok glass' -> 'Options' -> 'Overlay'
 10. Toggle Quality High/Low with 'Ok glass' -> 'Options' -> 'Quality'
 11. Close app with 'Close'

### Taken mode
If Autosave is not set, after taking a picture (or video recording has been stopped), saying 'Ok Glass' you're presented with another menu which allows to:

1. 'Save' : save the taken media
2. 'Discard': discard the taken media and get back to preview mode
3. 'Share': share the taken media on social networks / email

## Touchpad
### Preview mode
1. Single finger tap on the touchpad shows scrollable configuration toggles for Geotagging, Autosave, Max zoom, Smooth zoom and Overlays (Only on autosave, look 6)
2. Swipe left/right zooms in/out
3. Press on the camera button to take a photo
4. Longpress on the camera button to start recording
5. Tap touchpad to stop recording if recording a video
6. If not autosaving and while recording only, tap on the touchpad to save taken picture or video (or swipe down to delete)

### Taken mode
If Autosave is not set, after taking a picture (or video recording has been stopped), single tapping the touchpad you're presented with scrollable cards to Save, Discard or Share the taken media.

# Currently implemented:
* Everything is fully functional for taking pictures and recording videos (saved in /sdcard/DCIM/Camera), but no display and share yet

# TODO:
* Sharing
* Find a way to use built-in autobackup, unfortunately taking pictures using the Camera API seems to not trigger the autobackup correctly even when saving the media to the DCIM/Camera folder and triggering the MediaScanner to refresh. If some Google engineer reads, please please please tell me how to overcome this, there's a long standing bug filed (https://code.google.com/p/google-glass-api/issues/detail?id=588). Or, i will simply do it my way and reverse your original camera app :)
* Find a way to display the taken media in the timeline using the Mirror API (since Google removed the capability of simply creating static cards in the timeline). Or, i will revert to use my own internal viewer.
* Some more features: take-picture burst mode, timed videos, face recognition, qrcode scanning
* Provide head-scrolling menus (at the moment, 'Ok google' menus are fixed to 6 elements and non scrollable)
* Remove 'Ok google' and use custom commands ?

# Compile with:
The usual android studio (needs Android SDK 19 with the Glass Preview SDK)

# Bye!
cowabunga, ciao, bacetti :)

And please, Google .... you rock .... reconsider Glass, they're awesome!
